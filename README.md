# Graduation_Project_BREAST CANCER_using ML
â€¢	IDENTIFYING GENE BIOMARKERS GUIDING THE TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER:
the graduation project use python language to predict type of treatment feature is gene profile steps i do to finish project:
1.  collect data 
2. clean the data
3. feature selection to avoid overfitting (use variance threshold (most of gene same in all classes)
4. balance class (use smote algorithm to avoid giving priority  to some classes that have great number of record) 
5. apply model (svm,logestic regression,randomforest)
